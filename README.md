This is a branch from gSender from Sienci labs.  It is not the main code, but
somewhere to experiment with different features, in particular, using
a cell phone picture of your cnc bed to create a preview of where the cnc
machine will cut, and also enabling you to click on the image to move
the cnc machine to the clicked location.  It is a work in progress.  I may
not be the one that has the final code to do this, but is just a place to have
fun and see what is possible.

I created a folder called Docker where I have a Docerfile to build an image
for development, and a file called postDockerbuild.sh where I have some
post build commands to run to finish off the process.

Right now I am stuck at getting openCV to work with javascript/nodejs.
I'll probably give this a pause.  Right now it complains about not being
able to find child_process, even though I have installed that with npm.

I am brand new to javascript and nodejs, so it may be something simple to fix.
This is not official, and just a place to experment.  I'm open to suggestions
on how to get opencv to work with nodejs from anyone who has done this before.
See buildDocerk.bat, Docerfile, and postDockerbuild.sh to see what I've tried.

# ![gSender logo](https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/sender/blob/master/src/app/images/icon-git.png?raw=true)gSender: connect to and control [Grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl)-based CNCs

gSender is a feature-packed CNC interface software designed to be clean and easy to learn while retaining a depth of capabilities for advanced users. Its development was begun out of a passion for hobby CNC machines: an interface rebuilt to suit the needs of the at-home CNC user.
* Accepts standard, GRBL-compliant g-code and has been verified to work with many of the common CAM programs
* Began development to bring new concepts to the existing landscape of GRBL senders in an effort to advance functionality and ease-of-use
* Javascript-based CNC interface software which leverages [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for cross platform use
* Is a branch off of the popular [CNCjs CNC controller interface](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs) 

Some things that weâ€™re looking to accomplish with this sender:
* Reliability of operation
* Accommodates all ranges of computing systems (low-end PC to RasPi | â€˜light modeâ€™)
* Clean and easy to use no matter your previous CNC experience
* Makes available all normally expected functions
* Addresses common error throwing conditions automatically
* Built-in gadgets for surface probing, stock flattening, firmware editing, and g-code editing with syntax highlighting, command navigation, and more
* 3D cutting visualization
